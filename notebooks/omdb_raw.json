      "Title": "Judith of Bethulia",
      "Year": "1914",
      "Rated": "Not Rated",

      "Runtime": "61 min",

      "Plot": "A fascinating work of high artistry, \"Judith of Bethulia\" will not only rank as an achievement in this country, but will make foreign producers sit up and take notice. It has a signal and imperative message, and the technique displayed throughout an infinity of detail, embracing even the delicate film tinting and toning, marks an encouraging step in the development of the new art. Ancient in story and settings, it is modern in penetrative interpretation - it is a vivid history of one phase of the time it concerns, and is redemptive as well as relative, a lesson from one of those vital struggles that made and unmade nations as well as individuals, yet it is not without that inspiring influence that appeals powerfully to human sense of justice. The entire vigorous action of the play works up to the personal sacrifice of Judith of Bethulia, a perilous chance she takes for the sake of the lives and happiness of her people. She dares expose herself to overwhelming humiliation and dishonor in a challenge of beauty to strength, struggles through a conversion of sentiment that makes the high crisis more acute, and sets at defiance the \"better-death-than-dishonor\" platitude, escaping both through that all-conquering combination in a woman, great physical beauty joined to lofty intelligence. She enters upon a relation of constant peril - only delicate treatment saves the situation at times - abandons her native purity of conduct and dares her own undoing, yet the noble end justified the dangerous means, and she emerges idealized by her people, an apotheosis of splendid womanhood. Bethulia is a fortified town of Judea, guarding a hill pass through which an invading Assyrian army must march in order to enter Judea. In the town lives Judith, a devout young woman of lofty character and remarkable beauty, when the place is stormed by Holofernes at the head of a large army. The fighting before the gate brings into action an enormous number of soldiers on both sides, and those engines of war, such as the battering ram and catapult, which were used by the fighting male of other days under close condition of furious combat. One desperate assault after another is repelled, scaling ladders are thrown down, great rocks are showered upon the invaders, and the wonder is that they keep at it. The reason is that Holofernes has a way of torturing and killing unsuccessful captains. As officer had better die in the thick of battle than return with a confession of defeat. Holofernes is as merciless as nature to all who fail. The great leader's brutality of his captains when they do not succeed in carrying the fortress by storm indicates what the inhabitants of Bethulia may expect in the event of capture and serves to intensify the clash of character later on - it adds peril to the undertaking of Judith when she resolves to sacrifice herself for her people. Holofernes, after making a horrible example of defeated captains by frightful torture, resorts to strategy. His soldiers have seized the wells from which the inhabitants of Bethulia obtained their water supply, and their leader adopts waiting tactics, diverting himself with dancing girls to break the tedium. Bethulia is on the verge of famine, and the besieged are almost ready to surrender the fortress and all Judea to the spoilers, when Judith goes forth in her finest raiment, accompanied only by her maid, enters the Assryian camp and obtains an interview with the merciless Holofernes. Against his formidable strength, his brutal ferocity and cunning, his absolute power, are matched her fascinating personality directed by intelligence and hidden purpose. She is willing to carry \"her fault on her shoulders like a coronation mantle.\" The dangerous and difficult situation from this point to Judith's terrible triumph and the defeat of the invading Assyrians is pictured without loss of force or charm by extreme delicacy of treatment. Beauty is constantly asserted by almost reckless prodigality in the matter of costume, and by the appeal of delightful acting. The feminine sweetness and shyness of the lovely Judith are intensified by her advances and retreats in measuring her sex attractions against his formidable power. She is weakened at the critical moment by a sudden flame of passion and compassion aroused in her breast, but self-control returns at a thought of all that is at stake, the safety and happiness of thousands of her people, and she dares be all and do all that revolts her finer nature from a deep hatred of injustice and wrong meted out to her peace-loving kindred and friends, from a noble desire to preserve her country and the destinies of her race.",

A few moments after a well-dressed stranger steps from behind the curtains and, with the coolest of sangfroid, steals the valuables in the very presence of the princess, and with a polite bow hands her his card and makes a dignified exit. Upon the card the name \"Fantomas\" slowly appears. The police are quickly upon the scene, but Fantomas, true to his nom de plume, has vanished. Inspector Robert Juve is the sleuth entrusted to track the mysterious marauder. But before Juve has time to move in the matter of the princess's jewels and cash, another escapade of Fantomas' is thrust upon him to investigate. Lord Beltham is missing. Juve calls on Lady Beltham, and in a man's hat finds the initial \"G.\" With so slight a clue Juve tracks down \"Gurn\" (none other than the elusive Fantomas) to his lodgings and makes the ghastly discovery of Lord Beltham's dead body in one of \"Gurn's\" traveling trunks, and a packet of the special Fantomas cards establishes the connection between \"Gurn\" and Fantomas; they are one and the same man. Three months elapse. \"Gurn\" has been tried and condemned to die by the guillotine. Lady Beltham's name has not yet appeared in connection with the case, and the story goes that the murder was the outcome of a violent quarrel between \"Gurn\" and Beltham, yet she is enamored of the gentlemanly scoundrel and sets about seeking a method of escape for him. By means of liberal bribes, the aid of Warden Nibet is enlisted and he arranges an interview between the condemned man and Lady Beltham in a house overlooking the prison. That night a new play has been produced by a famous actor, Valgrand, who, acting the role of a condemned felon, adds a realistic touch by making up exactly to resemble \"Gurn.\" At Lady Beltham's invitation, Valgrand, still made up as \"Gurn,\" visits her at 2 A.M., and partaking of drugged coffee, is rendered incapable of action. Warden Nibet returns and takes back his prisoner, no longer \"Gurn,\" alias Fantomas, but the unfortunate Valgrand, who goes through all the terrible preliminaries of a criminal's execution, aye, even to the point of being led to the guillotine, before inspector Juve makes the startling discovery that Fantomas has once more eluded him. Henceforth it is to be a fight between a clever, scheming, mysterious rogue on one hand, and inspector Juve, Chief of the Detective Dept. of Paris, on the other.",

The villain escapes from prison and makes his way to the railroad station and boards a train where he is tracked by private detectives. When the train stops at a country station, Fantomas alights with the intention of making good his escape, but he finds that he is being followed by two detectives, whom he recognizes. He goes back to his carriage, which leads the detectives to think he is quite safe, but he crosses the train and leaves by the opposite door, jumping into the baggage wagon of the train on the opposite rail. Just at that moment the train moves and a magistrate who happens to have nearly missed the train also jumps into the baggage wagon. Fantomas was who hiding, attacks the magistrate, and after a severe struggle in which he is victorious assumes the disguise of the magistrate and takes his clothes and papers. He continues the journey as the magistrate, successfully rescues certain criminals, who are brought before him to be tried, and manages to blackmail several members of society, with whom he is brought in contact. While here he is recognized by Fandor, the young and clever journalist who happens to come into the district and who has suspicions as to the authenticity of the magistrate. He decides to keep watch upon him. His suspicions are well founded and he identifies the magistrate as none other than Fantomas. After much trouble, he is able to get papers committing Fantomas to prison, but Fantomas' suspecting his immediate arrest, issues an order to the head warden, and tells him that it is Detective Juve's intention to be arrested disguised as Fantomas. The warden is not to tell a soul of the detective's intentional disguise, but is to let him remain in prison until 12 o'clock midnight, when the head warden is to personally release him. The police, not suspecting anything of this, feel quite safe when Fantomas is put in the cell and securely barred and locked. His scheme works favorably and once more Fantomas is at large.",

      "Plot": "Balduin, a student of Prague, leaves his roystering companions in the beer garden, when he finds he has reached the end of his resources. He is scarcely seated in a quiet corner when a hideous, shriveled-up old man taps him upon the shoulder and whispers vaguely of a big inheritance for Prague's finest swordsman and wildest student if he will enter into a certain agreement. Balduin rebuffs him, satirically asking his weird companion to procure him \"the luckiest ticket in a lottery or a doweried wife.\" The old man goes off chuckling and thence onward persistently shadows Balduin, exerting a sinister influence over him, while Balduin is still disconsolate under the frowns of fortune. The Countess Margit Schwarzenberg, hunting with her cousin, to whom her father has betrothed her, meets with an accident. She is thrown over her horse's head into a river, but Balduin, who has been directed to the spot by his evil genius, plunges in and rescues her. Subsequently Balduin calls to inquire as to her condition at the castle of her father, the count, but be makes a hurried departure when Baron Waldis arrives, the contrast in their appearance discrediting him. His desire to win the countess and to humiliate the baron becomes so pronounced that he readily accedes to the compact suggested by Scapinelli, the old man, who has so pertinaciously dogged his footsteps, particularly when he learns that untold wealth and power will be his when he assigns to the other the right to take from his room whatever he chooses for his own use as he desires. The agreement is signed. Balduin receives a shower of gold and notes as his portion; Scapinelli takes Balduin's soul exposed in concrete form by his shadow. Balduin prosecutes his love affair assiduously and with apparent success, till the baron is informed of it by a jealous gypsy girl. He challenges Balduin to a duel, and the latter, assured of his superiority as a fencer, readily agrees. Count Schwarzenberg learns of the impending duel and appeals to Balduin not to kill \"my sister's child, my daughter's future husband, and my heir.\" Balduin gives his promise, but when he goes to the venue of the duel he meets, his own counterpart stalking away derisively wiping his gory sword on his cloak. Balduin turns and in the far distance sees the dying victim of the deed he swore he would not do. He rushes from the spot horror-stricken. When he regains sufficient composure he makes his way to the castle of the count, but is refused admission. Determined to explain that he had no complicity in the death of the baron, Balduin climbs into a room in which the countess is seated. She receives him coldly, but soon succumbs to his ardent wooing. Just as he seeks to leave her she notices he has no shadow and that the mirror gives no reflection of him; and she drops back affrighted, the ghastly apparition of himself which takes shape in the corner of the room sends Balduin scuttling away from the castle in a paroxysm of terror. He makes a frenzied flight through a woodland estate and the streets of Prague, but wherever he stops to recover his breath he is haunted by the counterpart of himself. He reaches his rooms and draws a murderous looking fire-arm from its case. As the phantasmagorical figure strides towards him with a sinister grin, he fires, and in a few minutes the blood gushes from his own side from a fatal wound.",

Virgil knows another way to go, but this leads straight through the entire Inferno, before it continues towards Paradise. Virgil leads Dante to the portals of Inferno. Charon ferries them over the river Acheron, and then they start their journey downwards through the different circles of Inferno. Dante meets all kind of sinners and sees the never-ending punishments they have to undergo. The various punishments are adjusted to the different transgressions. Among the sinners Dante recognizes many persons he has met in Florence, when they were still alive. They tell him their sad stories and why they have ended here. At last Dante and Virgil meets the arch traitor Lucifer, who holds the bodies of Brutus and Cassius in his mouth. The two poets climb down the shaggy sides of Lucifer, to reach the subterranean way which leads out of Inferno.",

      "Plot": "Naturally, after his last experience, Inspector Juve winces under such rebuff as the substitution of Valgrand and the escape of Fantomas. Eventually a mysterious crime puzzles him and his assistant, Fandor. To the chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, he reports that the body of a woman, found in the house of Dr. Charles, cannot be identified. Papers bearing the name of Lady Beltham had been discovered in her clothing. Was the body that of Lady Beltham, the accomplice of Gurn, or was it the intention that people should believe that she was dead? Juve wondered why the body was found in the house of Dr. Charles. He concerns himself to watch the house, and the patience of Fandor and himself is unexpectedly rewarded. One day Dr. Charles leaves the house, and the car in which he rides is followed. Charles makes a false move. The man who leaves the closed car is not the Dr. Charles who got in. He is now a young man, with a black moustache, whereas Charles is a middle-aged man with a black beard. That is decidedly suspicions, and the detectives are in time to see him accept a note from a woman who is waiting for him. Instructing Fandor to follow the girl, Juve goes after the other man, known to the police as Lawrence, the leader of bandits. Following Lawrence (alias Charles) in a taxi, he is fated to lose his quarry, as an accomplice of the bandit punctures the tire of one of the wheels, and Juve is stranded in a street while Lawrence gets clear away. So far there is nothing to connect Charles, alias Lawrence, with Fantomas, alias Gurn. Fandor fares much better. The girl does not succeed in throwing the younger detective off the track and is apparently unconscious of the fact that she is being followed until she notices Fandor in the same compartment of the railway carriage in which she is traveling. Fandor tracks her to a house. Having seen her safely indoors, he sends a note to Juve, saying that he is keeping a good watch. Meanwhile, Lawrence has rend the note Josephine handed him, and he learns that an elderly man, confidential clerk in the employment of Messrs, Brown and Co., has fallen in love with her. That afternoon he is taking $30,000 to clients of the firm, and thinking that she is attached to him, wishes to take her with him on the journey. They were leaving the Gare de Lyon Station for Bercy by the Northern Express at three o'clock that afternoon. Would Lawrence be at the station with others of the gang? In consequence of the breakdown of the car, the note which Fandor had written did not reach Juve. Fandor, however, had waited near the house of the girl, and when she left, dressed as a lady, followed her to the Gare de Lyon, where she met the confidential messenger. No doubt there was a hidden meaning in this meeting, and Fandor decided to join the train; so did Lawrence and others of the gang whom he had gathered round him. The whole party traveled in the last coach of the train, and when the time bad arrived, one of the men climbed along the footboard and uncoupled the coach. Lawrence recognized Fandor, but his presence on the train made no difference to the plans of the bandits. As the coach began to fall away from the rest of the train, Josephine left the compartment in which a peremptory demand for the money be carried, whilst Fandor was also attacked. By this time the speed of the coach has very sensibly slackened and the gang easily escaped, fleeing in a motorcar waiting for them. In the car they examined the haul, and to their intense mortification discovered that the notes the man carried were all half notes, the remainder of which were to be handed to the clients of Brown and Co. when the contract was completed. When Fandor recovered from the shock of the attack he pulled the communication cord. To his consternation he found that not only had it been severed, but that the coach was running down the decline. He knew that the Northern Express was following the train in which he had traveled, and nothing but a miracle would avert a serious disaster. The coach ran back, and as the express began to cross the bridge the engine collided with the coach and the whole train was terribly wrecked. Lawrence determines to obtain the remaining halves of the notes, but decides that before doing so Juve must be killed. With that purpose in view, he, in the name of Fandor, wires to Juve to come to the Bercy cellars of Brown and Co. the following night. Juve, taking the wire as authentic, goes to Bercy, and. seeing someone moving behind the casks, fires, and then creeps forward, to run against Fandor. Lawrence and his accomplice began firing at the detectives, the barrels of spirit were set on fire, and through a tornado of flames the detectives escape. Fantomas again himself escapes, and they lose entire trace of him until one night when at a hotel, Juve and Fandor meet Josephine, and after Juve is introduced by Fandor, he insists that Josephine divulge the whereabouts of Fantomas. She reluctantly, under the threat of arrest, takes Juve to a place where Fantomas is dining with two wealthy young ladies in the disguise of the supposed Dr. Charles. A card is sent to Fantomas saying that someone is waiting for him outside. Fantomas, believing this to be one of his gang, departs from the hotel and is immediately arrested by Juve and Fandor. After they walk down the street, Dr. Charles suddenly makes a struggle and to the amazement of Juve and Fandor, he leaves in their hands nothing but two plaster casts of his arms with his coat sleeves attached. They decide to track Lady Beltham. After much trouble they discover her to be making midnight visits to her old haunted villa. Here they make a visit in the day-time, and being satisfied that there must be still some connection between Fantomas and Lady Beltham, hide and overhear a conversation where Faniomas decides be must get rid of Juve and will send a silent executioner to destroy him. Juve does not exactly know what this silent executioner means, but he prepares to receive a serpent. He is almost crushed to death in spite of his precaution, but survives and surrounds the haunted villa of Lady Beltham. Fantomas is almost caught unprepared, but being ever ready, he quickly sets a trap in which to get together the whole of the police, including Juve and Fandor, so that he may destroy them all by dynamite. These easily fall into the trap, so quickly but well laid. Fantomas realizes that his opportunity has come, and leaping from a cistern in which he had been hiding, he touches the coil of wire and explodes the dynamite cartridge, blowing the haunted villa to a heap of ruins, together with the occupants. The question still remains unsolved: Are Juve and Fandor still alive?",

Her father, a prosperous merchant, was preparing to send her to the West to be educated. For centuries the Armenians had been terrorized by the Turks, but this was a period of serenity between the Turks and the Christian-Armenians. However, the War had hit Europe, and the Turks had informed the American ambassador, Henry Morganthau, in Constantinople, that the Armenians were giving support to the Turks' enemy, Russia. Despite Morgantheau's objections, the Turks issue a decree that the Armenians must be moved southward into the desert. The Turkish governor, a Pasha, comes to Aurora's father and demands she be given him as a bride. The father tells him his daughter will not give up her Christian belief, as she would have to do to marry a Muslim. The governor leaves in anger. The order is given for the removal of the Armenians. The men are separated from the women, and the Armenian soldiers are forced to disrobe and dig a trench, and then are shot down by the Turks. Mothers are torn away from their children and the Armenians are marched away into the desert where, famine, thirst and fierce heat await them. Aurora escapes to a mission school ran by Edith Graham, an English girl. The Turk soldiers surround the school and Miss Graham protests under the protection of the English flag to no avail,as the Turks trample the flag, and the Armenian girls are dragged away. Miss Graham, determined to help the girls as much as she possibly can, disguises herself as one of them and joins the march.",

We see the contents of his stomach causing pain and distress; then he has vivid and surreal nightmares. Will Metz succeed in driving Daniel to suicide?",

Stiller obviously delights in teasing his audience with each scandalous plot twist and every salacious leer, and the result is a deliciously subversive comedy that was very much ahead of its time.",

Sir George goads Jekyll into visiting a music hall, where he watches the alluring dancer Gina. Jekyll becomes fascinated with the two contrasting sides of human nature, and he becomes obsessed with the idea of separating them. After extensive work in his laboratory, he devises a formula that does indeed allow him to alternate between two completely different personalities, his own and that of a brutish, lascivious person whom he names Hyde. It is not long before the personality of Hyde begins to dominate Jekyll's affairs.",

Griffith's epic Intolerance, Denmark's greatest director, Carl Theodor Dreyer (The Passion of Joan of Arc, Vampyr), was inspired to make his own four-episode historical epic with each story told end to end, anthology-style, linked by theme to the others. The unifying character, Satan, attempts to win God's favor but is doomed to cheerless participation in dark episodes of human history: the temptation of Jesus, the Spanish Inquisition, the French Revolution and the Russo-Finnish war of 1918. Few directors resisted compromise and convention the way Dreyer did; fortunately, the Nordisk Film Company was artistically progressive by Hollywood standards and agreed that this should be a prestige film made to the highest standards. More than two years in production, Dreyer not only directed but also controlled every facet of this ambitious production.",

Disheartened, she returns to Piney Woods to help a reverend running a school for young negroes. Sylvia learns that the reverend hasn't the heart to turn away poor students, and unless he can raise $5,000 to supplement the $1.49 per child per year that the state supplies, the school will be closed. She goes up north again to try to raise the money and has little success, but meets kindly negro, Dr. V. Vivian, who helps her regain her stolen purse. When she saves a child from being hit by an auto, she herself is slightly injured. But the owner of the car is philanthropist Mrs. Elena Warwick, who is sympathetic to her quest and promises to donate the $5,000 to the school. Her bigoted southern friend, Mrs. Stratton, tries to talk her out of the donation, and Mrs. Warwick gets so incensed she raises the amount to $50,000. Her job done, Sylvia returns to Piney Woods. But Dr. Vivian has fallen in love with Sylvia and goes to Alma to try to find her. There he learns the shocking details of her past and that of her family.",

They plan on selling him the one across the way from Hutter's own home. Hutter leaves his innocent wife, Ellen, with some friends while he is away. Hutter's trek is an unusual one, with many locals not wanting to take him near the castle where strange events have been occurring. Once at the castle, Hutter does manage to sell the Count the house, but he also notices and feels unusual occurrences, primarily feeling like there is a dark shadow hanging over him, even in the daytime when the Count is unusually asleep. Hutter eventually sees the Count's sleeping chamber in a crypt, and based on a book he has recently read, believes the Count is really a vampire or Nosferatu. While Hutter is trapped in the castle, the Count, hiding in a shipment of coffins, makes his way to Wisbourg, causing death along his way, which most attribute to the plague. Hutter himself tries to rush home to save his town and most importantly save Ellen from Nosferatu's imminent arrival. In Wisbourg, Ellen can feel the impending darkness as Nosferatu gets closer. But she learns that a sinless woman can sacrifice herself to kill the vampire. Will Hutter be able to save Ellen either from Nosferatu and/or her self-sacrifice?",
